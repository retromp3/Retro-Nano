Retro Nano is an attempt to bring back the iPod Nano 6th Gen. experience to WatchOS. This app will work independently from [Retro](https://beta.retromusic.co). for iOS & Android.

Currently it's all UI, but it is somewhat functional. You can play some of the pre-loaded songs and open a couple menus, but that's about it. There's a lot that needs to be done, but feel free to play around with it and contribute!

The end-goal is to have it support Apple Music + Spotify, which frankly is easier said than done.
